### How it works

- Third-party gets permission from the user to utilize the data via push protocol.
- Once the user accepts their request, Mina protocol generates contracts.
- After generating contracts, users give a push to a third party as proof.
- Third-party get the push from push protocol, they get the data from Mina protocol.

### Architecture Overview


### How itâ€™s made
- Use push protocol and polygon to inform users that a third party gets access to their data.
- Use IPFS to store our health data.
- Use Mina protocol to reveal data attributes while keeping health data privacy.

### Benefits

### For users

- Control access and use of your data through fine-grained permissions
- Just reveal data attributes while keeping data private

### For self-tracking Apps

- Connected real-world data yields better insights for your users
- Connect to a user's existing data to keep data privacy

### For Pharmaceutical Companies

- Link clinical trial data to medical claims and electronic health record data to conduct long-term safety and efficacy studies.
- Refine models for finding rare disease patients by linking diagnostic lab, genomic, and imaging data
- Discover new therapeutic candidates with connected data

### For Insurers

- Improve value-based care analytics and sharpen total cost of care estimates by linking to EHR and clinical data
- Hone risk adjustment factor calculations by linking claims to social determinant data, to properly estimate the true cost of patient care
